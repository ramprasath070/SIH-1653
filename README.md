## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

* Virtual Boardroom Experience Simulated real-life interview panel with structured questioning. Adaptive ice-breaking questions, transitioning into techno-managerial discussions. Multi-expert panel interface for 
  live and asynchronous evaluation.
* Intelligent Question Selection AI-driven question relevance analysis based on candidate’s domain expertise. Question bank categorized by technical depth, managerial acumen, and experience level. Dynamic         
  question sequencing to maintain logical interview flow.
* Candidate Response Evaluation AI-powered natural language processing (NLP) to assess relevance, depth, and coherence of answers. Scoring model comparing candidate responses against expected benchmarks. 
  Automated summarization of candidate strengths and improvement areas.
* Expert Panel Assistance Real-time feedback on question relevance to ensure unbiased interviews. Expert scoring module with aggregated ratings for objective assessment. AI-generated suggestions for follow-up 
  questions based on candidate responses.
* Final Suitability Scoring Weighted scoring mechanism considering: Relevance of questions posed by experts. Relevance and depth of candidate’s responses. Overall subject knowledge & suitability for the role. 
  Automated ranking system to streamline decision-making.
